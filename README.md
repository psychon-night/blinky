# Blinkity Project
A silly library to allow the capslock key's LED to output morse code

## Using the Library

Open `blink` and locate the line reading `h;e;l;l;o; w;o;r;l;d`\
Replace this line with your message, such as `h;i; t;h;e;r;e`

## Make your keyboard blinky

CD into the folder: `cd blinkity`\
Make file executable: `chmod +777 blink`\
then execute: `./blink`

## Other Stuff

Feel free to improve and play around with this. If you'd like to make your changes official, open a pull request\
Have fun!
