# Blinkity Project
A silly library to allow the capslock key's LED to output morse code

## Using the Library

Open `blink` and locate the line reading `h;e;l;l;o; w;o;r;l;d`\
Replace this line with your message, such as `h;i; t;h;e;r;e`

OR you could use the Python file for a more user-friendly experience\
Check out blinkboard.py for more information

#### THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THE OLD SHELL SCRIPT VERSION. USE THE PYTHON VERSION INSTEAD

## Make your keyboard blinky

CD into the folder: `cd blinkity`\
Make file executable: `chmod +x blink`\
then execute: `./blink`

## Getting PERMISSION DENIED errors

CD into the bin folder\
Make everything executable: `chmod +x *`\
CD into the bin/alphabet folder\
Make everything executable: `chmod +x *`\
