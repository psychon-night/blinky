# Blinkity Project
A silly library to allow the capslock key's LED to output morse code

## Using the Library

Open `blink` and locate the line reading `h;e;l;l;o; w;o;r;l;d`\
Replace this line with your message, such as `h;i; t;h;e;r;e`

OR you could use the Python file for a more user-friendly experience

Open the .py file in a text editor, take a look at the comments\
At the bottom, there's a line that reads `parseInput("hello world")`\
You can put any string you like into this function and it'll spit out the morse code :3

## Make your keyboard blinky

CD into the folder: `cd blinkity`\
Make file executable: `chmod +x blink`\
then execute: `./blink`

## Getting PERMISSION DENIED errors

CD into the bin folder\
Make everything executable: `chmod +x *`\
CD into the bin/alphabet folder\
Make everything executable: `chmod +x *`\
