# capslockKey-blinkity
A stupid library to enable morse blinking of the keyboard's Shift Lock key

## Using the Library
Open `blinkCore` and find the line reading `h;e;l;l;o;w;o;r;l;d`. Delete that line, as well as the second example, and write out your message like so:

`m;y;s;e;c;r;e;t;m;e;s;s;a;g;e`

CD into the folder: `cd blinkity` then execute blinkCore `./blinkCore`
